- # Approach 1:- Using Priority Queue
    - ### Intuition:
        The problem asks us to transform a list of gift values by repeatedly replacing the largest value with its square root, for `k` operations. After these transformations, we need to return the total sum of the remaining values in the list.

        The key observation is that the most impactful transformations will be on the largest values, as they will decrease the most when replaced by their square roots. Therefore, a data structure that allows efficient access to the largest element is ideal. A **max-heap** (or a priority queue) is perfect for this, as it supports efficient extraction and insertion of the largest element.

    - ### Approach:
        1. **Use a max-heap**: First, convert the list of gifts into a max-heap. Since many priority queues are implemented as min-heaps, we can insert the negative values to simulate a max-heap.
        
        2. **Perform the transformation `k` times**: For each of the `k` operations, extract the largest value from the heap, compute its square root (rounded down), and push the transformed value back into the heap.

        3. **Sum the remaining values**: Once all transformations are done, the heap contains the final values of the gifts. Simply pop all elements from the heap and sum them to get the total value of the remaining gifts.

    - ### Code Implementation:
        - **Python Solution**
            ```python3 []
            class Solution:
                def pickGifts(self, gifts: List[int], k: int) -> int:
                    # Convert all gift values to negative for max-heap behavior using min-heap
                    gifts = [-x for x in gifts]
                    # Heapify the list to organize it as a heap
                    heapq.heapify(gifts)

                    # Perform the gift operation k times
                    for _ in range(k):
                        # Pop the maximum gift value (which is the smallest in the negative list)
                        x = heapq.heappop(gifts)
                        # Take the square root of the gift value (after converting it back to positive)
                        x = int(math.sqrt(-x))
                        # Push the transformed gift value back to the heap (make it negative again)
                        heapq.heappush(gifts, -x)

                    # Initialize variable to accumulate the remaining gift values
                    gifts_Left = 0

                    # Sum all the remaining gift values after k operations
                    while len(gifts) > 0:  gifts_Left += -heapq.heappop(gifts)  # Convert back to positive while summing

                    # Return the total value of remaining gifts
                    return gifts_Left
            ```

        - **C++ Solution**
            ```cpp []
            class Solution {
            public:
                long long pickGifts(vector<int>& gifts, int k) {
                    // Create a max-heap using priority_queue to store gift values
                    priority_queue<int> pq;
                    // Push all gift values into the max-heap
                    for(const int& x: gifts) pq.push(x);

                    // Perform the gift operation k times
                    while(k--) {
                        // Pop the maximum gift value from the heap
                        int x = pq.top(); pq.pop();
                        // Take the square root of the gift value
                        x = sqrt(x);
                        // Push the transformed gift value back into the heap
                        pq.push(x);
                    }

                    // Initialize a variable to accumulate the remaining gift values
                    long long gifts_Left = 0;
                    
                    // Sum all the remaining gift values
                    while(pq.size()) { gifts_Left += pq.top(); pq.pop(); }

                    // Return the total value of the remaining gifts
                    return gifts_Left;
                }
            };
            ```

    - ### Time Complexity:
        - **Heapify the gifts**: Building the heap from the initial list takes **O(n)** time, where `n` is the number of gifts.
        - **k transformations**: Each operation involves extracting the largest element (which takes **O(log n)**) and inserting the transformed value (which also takes **O(log n)**). Repeating this for `k` operations results in a total time complexity of **O(k log n)**.
        - **Summing the remaining values**: Finally, summing the values of the remaining gifts takes **O(n)** time.

        Thus, the overall time complexity is: O(n + k log n)


    - ### Space Complexity:
        - **Heap storage**: The space used by the heap to store all gift values is **O(n)**.
        - **Auxiliary space**: Apart from the heap, there is no significant extra space used.

        Therefore, the space complexity is: O(n)
